Module 21

**Overview of the analysis:** 
I've developed a sophisticated tool tailored for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup. This tool utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to sift through applicant data and identify those with the highest potential for success if granted funding by Alphabet Soup. By analyzing various features within the dataset, I've engineered a binary classifier that accurately predicts the likelihood of an applicant's success. Our goal was to achieve a minimum accuracy of 75% with this model.
