**Overview of the analysis:** 
I've developed a sophisticated tool tailored for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup. This tool utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to sift through applicant data and identify those with the highest potential for success if granted funding by Alphabet Soup. By analyzing various features within the dataset, I've engineered a binary classifier that accurately predicts the likelihood of an applicant's success. Our goal was to achieve a minimum accuracy of 75% with this model.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

**Data Preprocessing**

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?


What variable(s) are the features for your model?


What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?


**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


Were you able to achieve the target model performance?


What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
